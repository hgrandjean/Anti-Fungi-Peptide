## Setup on Windows

The following code block allows you to setup a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) on your Windows laptop. If you don't want to use a virtual environment, you can install your packages globally with the last line of the code block.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate # or .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat if you are using Windows cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
